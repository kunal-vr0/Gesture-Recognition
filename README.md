# Gesture-Recognition
This is a idea of this project is to train the software by recording different gestures and be able to recognise them.
I am using openCV for computer vision and meidapipe for hand detection.
For each hand gesture it records 144 data points and compare them with the recorded gesture and reports positively within some level of tolerance.

I hope to develope the software further and by making it much more accurate.
